Title: Elaphure Static Site Generator

Elaphure is a very simple but flexible static site generator inspired
by [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org). Unlike full-blown static site
generators, it comes without any bells and whistles out of the
box. Instead, Elaphure is powered by tools which are common to build
dynamic websites. The only difference is that you have to edit a file
to make change to the database of your website, rather than to submit
a web form.
